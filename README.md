# PUF_fingerprint_database
Peking University and Founder (PUF) database: A new rolled fingerprint database inÂ which each fingerprint contains forty impressions.

# Protocol
This fingerprint database is collected in Peking University. For each finger, we capture fingerprint images in two different periods. The time interval between two periods is at least two weeks. Besides, each finger are captured fingerprint images by two different sensors: PU-JY 203U and PU-JY 500U.
