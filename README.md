# Peking University and Founder (PUF) fingerprint database
A new rolled fingerprint database inÂ which each fingerprint contains forty impressions.

# Protocol
This fingerprint database is collected in Peking University to train deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). For each finger, we capture fingerprint images in two different periods. The time interval between two periods is at least two weeks. Besides, each finger are captured fingerprint images by two different sensors: PU-JY 203U and PU-JY 500U.

We hope that the database contains the following variations of the same finger:    
(1) Humidity of finger   
(2) Nonlinear distortion caused by pressure   
(3) Area of captured region   
(4) Stains   
(5) Temporal variations   
(6) Sensors   

# Database
This database contains 40000 images of 1000 fingers from 100 identities. Each finger contains 40 impressions (20 samples are captured by PU-JY 203U and 20 samples are captured by PU-JY 500U). The image size is 640x640 and the resolution is 500 dpi.
